# SSRL-BL-1-5-Data-Processing-Files

General Notes:

The .ipf files must be placed in the Igor Procedures folder, usually contained in: C:\Users\username\Documents\WaveMetrics\Igor Pro 9 User Files\Igor Procedures. They will be read into Igor upon startup.

If you are already running an instance of Igor Pro and do not want to reload the project file, you can open the added procedure file(s) (.ipf extension) from the Igor Procedures folder and click "Compile" at the bottom of the Igor procedure window.





SSRL BL 1-5 Transmission Correction:

The SSRLBL15_SAXS_Transmission.ipf file requires the associated SAXS_Experiment_Transmission.pxp Igor project file since the Nika GUI has been modified to read in an associated "air" image.
